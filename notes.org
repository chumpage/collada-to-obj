  - material/texture support
    - [ ] create a default Material and use it on each Mesh that doesn't have a material
    - [ ] use the Material ID for the name in the obj output, and instance the materials properly
    - [ ] support effect types other than <lambert>
  - [ ] add output to a custom, but ultra-simple, format
  - [ ] return -1 on error
  - [ ] figure out how to handle double-sided flag
  - add checks for the following
    - [ ] no transforms other than <matrix>
    - [ ] only <triangles>, no <tristrips> etc
    - [ ] only <p> element in <triangles>
    - [ ] only one set of texture coordinates used
  - [ ] performance improvement: cache read results
  - write more unit tests
    - vertex_format_has_tex_coords, vertex_format_indices, traverse_node,
      traverse_scene, to_obj, to_mtl, path_*, capture_stdout_stderr, InstanceGeom,
      verify_attr_val, Material, find_sid_match, read_texture, read_color,
